# aho-corasick
An implementation of the Aho-Corasick matching algorithm in C++

Currently this code builds a keyword dictionary from a CSV file then finds all matches with a directory of TXT files whose paths are listed in a CSV file.

Keyword dictionary CSV, list of search files CSV, and output location are all configured in config.json.
